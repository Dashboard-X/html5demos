Javascript Optimization
_______________________

Create a server-side or client-side script that takes a list of CDN hosted Javascript files and runs them through a
service like http://www.refresh-sf.com/yui/ whenever the list changes. The returned file can then be stored locally or
hosted on a CDN and included automatically.
